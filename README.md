"# Songs-Movies-REST-API" 

In this backend API users can register/login and and create their favorite songs and movies list in their profiles. Also with accessing the correct endpoints, they can reach to the other users profiles and like or comment the songs and movies. I tried to write this API according to ES7 standarts and used express framework and node packages for making it more asynchronous and practical.
