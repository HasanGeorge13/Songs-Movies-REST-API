"# Songs-Movies-REST-API" 

In this backend API users or admin can authorize and and create their favorite songs and movies list in their profiles. Also with accessing the correct endpoints, users can reach to the other users profiles and like or comment their songs and movies. They also can change their passwords if they forget in a secure enviroment. I tried to write this API according to ES7 standarts and used express framework and node packages for making it more asynchronous,efficient and practical.
